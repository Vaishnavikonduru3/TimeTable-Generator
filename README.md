# TimeTable-Generator
DBMS major project

Most college administrative work has been computerized, the
lecture timetable scheduling is still mostly done manually due to its inherent
difficulties. It is a Constraint satisfaction problem in which we find a solution
that satisfies the given set of constraints. A college timetable is a temporal
arrangement of a set of lectures and classrooms in which all given constraints
are satisfied. Creating such timetables manually is a complex and
time-consuming process. By automating this process with a computer
assisted timetable generator can save a lot of precious time.

Hence, we intend to develop a practical approach for building
lecture course timetabling systems, which can be customized to fit any
college's timetabling problem. We aim to develop an Timetable Generator
using PHP, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that contains an admin side from
where a user can manage all the timetables and records easily. The admin
plays an important role in the management of this system. In this project, the
user must perform all the main functions from the admin side. It contains the
teacher side and student side from where they can login and easily access the
timetable.
